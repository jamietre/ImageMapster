To manipulate all the options interactively, go to the [USA map demo][example-usa].

The basic version shown here demonstrates a few options:

- [altImage][cr-altimage] allows a different image to be used for both the highlight and select effects
- [staticState][cr-staticstate] - Washington is set to `false` which prevents it from being selected
- [isSelectable][cr-isselectable] - Oregon is set to `false` which prevents it from being selected
- [selected][cr-selected] - Texas and Maine are set to `true` meaning they will be automatically selected upon initialization

[See this demo in a JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/techfg/efs8zr65/latest)
