  /*
    Loading all the demo scripts (map.js) from here rather than within each demo component to
    avoid having to import jquery & imagemapster within each map.js.  We do this for a few
    reasons:
      1) We don't want to have import statements in the map.js because they are used directly
        in the "script" tab of the demo and in the associated jsFiddles. We could remove the
        code programatically when rendering the js code but because of #2 & #3, we just avoid
      2) We utilize the map.js in the associated JSFiddle's with a straight copy/paste (along
        with the map.html)
      3) A separate JS file will be generated for each component during build and the scripts
        themselves are small so for optimization, we put them all in to a single script
  */

  // jQuery is a CJS module so we wrap with ESM to obtain the export
  // and attach to window.  We have to do this in a separate file
  // otherwise the code that sets window.$ will be placed below
  // all the import statements in the generated bundle.
  import './jquery-loader.ts';
  import '../../../../../dist/jquery.imagemapster.mjs';
