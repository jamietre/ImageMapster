This example shows how to use ImageMapster to create menus. The image was taken from a [CSS tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20130430154223/http://css.flepstudio.org/en/css-tutorials/image-map-in-css.html) showing how to use CSS to create menus. The example uses ImageMapster instead to
create a more interesting menu with almost no code. The example uses [includeKeys][cr-includeKeys]
to highlight areas other than the one which is activated, and [altImage][cr-altimage]
to render the highlight with an alternate image (instead of just filling). The vertical
space above each menu will also activate the menu, but won't itself highlight.
