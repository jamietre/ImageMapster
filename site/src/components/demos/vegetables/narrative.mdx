Simple example demonstrating [singleSelect][cr-singleselect] which allows only one area to be selected, and changing a [tooltip][cr-tooltip] on the fly. The dip has a tooltip, which is different if asparagus is selected. This also shows how to use area-specific options to control the styling of each area individually. Some areas use different colors for selection to ensure that the highlight is visible even though each area is a substantially different color.
