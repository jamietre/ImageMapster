This example shows how to manually resize maps dynamically with the [resize][ar-resize] method. Resizing an active
mapster-bound image map will retain all current state data. With VML (IE < 8), the actual selection data can't be resized dynamically, so it will be redrawn after
the operation finishes. By using images that have a larger native size than the initial display size, resizing can be used to zoom and enhance detail.

You can also configure ImageMapster to automatically resize images (e.g., when the browser window resizes) via the [autoResize][cr-autoresize] option in order to avoid having to manually handle resizing.

During a resize (manual or auto), ImageMapster can adjust the image map of any image loaded to its effective size. That is, if you have an image map that doesn't
match the size you need to use in an application, you can just set the CSS or height/width properties for an image to whatever you need, and ImageMapster will automatically
adjust the `area` data in the image map. Automatic scaling is the default behavior, however if you _do not_ want this functionality, it can be disabled by setting [scaleMap][cr-scalemap] option.

At this time, scaling during a resize only works when the aspect ratio is maintained. While it won't stop you from changing the size to different proportions from its natural ones, the results will be unpredictable.
