} from '../../../components/features';

ImageMapster makes HTML image maps useful. It is a [jQuery plugin](https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/) that lets you activate [HTML Image Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) without using Flash. It works
just about everywhere that Javascript does, including modern browsers, Internet Explorer 6+, and mobile devices like iPads, iPhones and Androids.

See [getting started](./getting-started.md) for information on how to install and use ImageMapster.

## Features

### Highlight and select areas

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature imageFilename="highlight.gif" altText="Highlight Areas">
    <FeatureDetail>
      Automatic  highlighting of HTML image maps on mouseover
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>

      [fade effects][cr-fade], and more for highlight and select
    </FeatureDetail>
  </Feature>

  <Feature imageFilename="multiple.gif" altText="Select Areas">

      by disabling [isSelectable][cr-isselectable]
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Use like a toggle or menu with the [singleSelect][cr-singleselect]
      option
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Define areas as inactive or always active with
      [staticState][cr-staticstate]
    </FeatureDetail>
  </Feature>

### Create cool effects using alternate images

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature imageFilename="alt.gif" altText="Alternate Images">
    <FeatureDetail>
      Use any other image to render fill and select effects with
      [altImage][cr-altimage]
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Regular fills and borders can be used in combination with alternate image

</FeatureGrid>

### Bind the image map to an external list

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature imageFilename="external.gif" altText="External Lists">
    <FeatureDetail>
      Link user actions to an external list using [boundList][cr-boundlist]
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Automatically generate list from user-defined attributes in the image map
      data with [onGetList][cr-ongetlist], optionally sorted by specifying a sort order
      using [sortlist][cr-sortlist]
    </FeatureDetail>
  </Feature>
</FeatureGrid>

### Show tooltips for areas or area groups

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature imageFilename="tooltip.gif" altText="Tooltip">
    <FeatureDetail>Effortlessly create area-specific [tooltips][cr-areatooltipoptions]</FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>Use the default tooltip container, or create a custom [toolTipContainer][cr-tooltipcontainer] using any HTML template</FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>Manually activate or deactivate tooltips with the [tooltip][ar-tooltip] method</FeatureDetail>
  </Feature>
</FeatureGrid>

### Use masks to create complex functionality

<FeatureGrid>
  <Feature imageFilename="group.gif" altText="Area Groups">
    <FeatureDetail>
      Group areas together into logical entities that will be selected or
      highlighted together
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>

    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Exclude areas inside of other areas by using [isMask][cr-ismask]
    </FeatureDetail>

    <FeatureDetail>
      Areas can be members of more than one group, allowing you to get creative.  For example, create
      concentric selection areas by defining an interior area as both a mask and
      its own selection group

## History

ImageMapster was created by [James Treworgy](https://github.com/jamietre).  It
started as a fork of David Lynch's [Maphilight](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight)
in early 2011. He wanted to add the ability to keep areas selected. Having a lot
of ideas for interesting things that could be done with image maps, he ended up
adding many more features. The code base that ImageMapster started from has
basically been re-written from the ground up, however a few parts of the code, most
notably the core VML rendering, still inherit directly from its Maphilight roots.

James put a great deal of effort into ensuring that ImageMapster will work
reliably in many environments. Often, images will not be finished loading when
the rest of a page has finished being configured. Javascript code will usually
begin running before some page images have finished loading. It is critical
that images be completely loaded before ImageMapster can configure itself: it
needs to know their native and display sizes, make copies, and do other work.
The software uses a number of different methods, depending on the browser, to
ensure that everything is ready when it begins configuration.

Additonally, ImageMapster will _queue commands_ issued to it before
configuration is complete. This means you can write post-configuration code
that works against your image map without concern for the timing of images
being loaded. Any commands that ImageMapster receives before it's done
configuring will be queued, and processed in order once configuration is
complete.

ImageMapster uses HTML5 canvases to do its work in modern browsers. In older
browsers (Internet Explorer 6-8) it uses VML to achieve similar effects.

ImageMapster works in all major browsers (IE6+, Firefox 2+, Opera, Chrome, Edge,
Safari) and on mobile devices.

James put in a lot of work making ImageMapster what it is today.  If inclined,
