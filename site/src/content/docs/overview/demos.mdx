The demonstrations on this page show how to use some of ImageMapster's features. The first, [USA Map](#usa-map), is an interactive demo
that lets you change many options interactively to see how they affect the image map. The other demos are far simpler and show how
to use specific features. The [Skeleton Joints](#skeleton-joints) demo is a project contributed by a user from a private web site.

See [live examples][live-examples] for a comprehensive set of examples from the [ImageMapster repository](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/tree/main/examples) and [JSFiddle](https://www.jsfiddle.net), all with complete source code.
