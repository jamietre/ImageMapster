ImageMapster activates the areas in HTML image maps so you can highlight and select them. It has lots of other features for manual control, tooltips, resizing, and more. It is designed to be compatible with every common platform, and is tested with Internet Explorer 6-10, Firefox 3.0+, Safari, Opera, and Chrome. It works on mobile devices and doesn't use Flash.

## Development

The below covers the ImageMapster jQuery plugin. For information on how to develop the ImageMapster website, see its [README](site/README.md).

You can simultaneously make changes to both the plugin and the website by running `npm run dev` in both the plugin (`./`) and site (`./site`) directories. Any changes made to the plugin will be reflected in the site as it is [imported directly](./site/src/components/demos/core/scripts.astro#L20) from the build output.

### Build

The source code is broken into several modules to make management easier and to make it possible to create feature-targeted builds. ImageMapster is built using grunt and can be invoked as follows:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM dependencies - `npm install`
3. Generate a Build:
   - Debug Build (uncompressed) - `npm run build`
   - Release Build (uncompressed/compressed/sourcemap) - `npm run dist`

### Dev

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM dependencies - `npm install`
3. Run the dev task - `npm run dev`

### Tests

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM dependencies - `npm install`
3. Run the test task - `npm run test`

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> By default, tests will run using the latest version of jQuery. The library to use when running tests can be changed via the dropdown.

### Examples

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM dependencies - `npm install`
