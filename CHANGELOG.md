- Rewrite in ES6/Typescript
- Update to modern build system (e.g. rollup/weback/etc.)
- Create React component
- Migrate to modern testframework

- AltImage enhancements: see below

### tooltip-enhancements branch

- [Issue 72](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/72): `scaleMap` not working propery when using bootstrap (css on `body` causing incorrect evaluation of native image size)
- Enhanced tooltip API to allow creating arbitrary tool tips bound to any area, or at an arbitrary position.

### altimage-enhancements branch

- Add `altImages` option that accepts an option defining aliases to alternate images. The name of each property is an alias that can be specified as a valid `altImage` option value elsewhere

Example use of this option:

```js
var config = {
  altImages: {
    roadmap: 'images/usamap-roads.png',
    elevation: 'images/uasmap-elevation.png'
  }
};
```

then:

```js
$('img').mapster('set', true, 'AZ', {
  altImage: 'roadmap'
});
```

The aliases can also be used in the initial configuration options, both globally and for specific areas.

## Version 1.2.6 - 2012.07.13

Bug Fixes:

- [Issue #69](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/69) `fill` setting not being honored sometimes in IE6-8
- [Issue #68](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/68) Accept `areas` array with dangling commas

## Version 1.2.5 - 2012.06.19

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #59](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/59), [Issue #55](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/55) Opacity/fade effects not working right in IE8
- [Issue #58](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/58) Resize not changing CSS for the `div` contiainer around the image elements
- [Issue #53](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/53) Not working in Google Chrome with Adblock plugin
- [Issue #44](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/44) Incorrect opacity with altImage
- [Issue #36](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/36) Resize firing callback before resize is finished
- Rebind not cleaning up resources properly
- Offset 1 pixel strokes by 0.5 px to prevent the fuzzies
- Ignore UI events during resize - can cause problems if highlights are activated during an effect

Features:

- [Issue #52](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/52) Add "clickNavigate" feature to allow basic image map functionality
- Add "highlight" option to programatically set/unset the highlight effect (as if a user just moused over an area vs. clicked)
- Detect touchscreen devices and disable "mouseover"
- [Issue #11](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/11) Detect excanvas automatically and force into IE mode if present

Notes

- refactor into modular architecture
- tighten up tooltip code a little
- Removed "attrmatches" jQuery selector exetnsion, recoded as a function, removed from tests
- Queue all methods (highlight, data, tooltip) so configuration delays don't cause problems
- Unbind "load" event explicitly from images added.
- Add dynamic images to DOM instead of loading through Javascript
- Ignore missing keys on some operations to increase stability with bad data
- Trim results of string splits so spaces don't cause problems
- Yet more tweaking of image loading detection
- Refactor "graphics" into an object and instantiate for each instance. "load" callbacks were changing event order, resulting in the single instance getting wires crossed. Isolated
  each map instance completely, problem solved.
- Fix canvases re-ordered after first selection making effect sometimes inconsistent
- Fix resize bug when area groups are used

## Version 1.2.4 - 2011.09.27

- [Issue #14](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/14) Resize bug in IE <9 fixed

## Version 1.2.3

- Resize with multiple images affecting other images - fixed

## Version 1.2.2 - 2011.09.22

- masks not working in Firefox 6.0 only. behavior of context.globalCompositeOperation='source-out' and
  save/restore somehow changed in ff6. updated code to not depend (possibly) on idiosyncracies of chrome
  and ie9. honestly not sure why it worked before as it appears I may have been doing something wrong,
  but the code is more explicit now and it works across all browsers.

## Version 1.2.1

- Click callback "this" is not set - fixed
- Replace u.isFunction with $.isFunction to save a few bytes

## Version 1.2

- fixed fader problem for old IE (again, really this time)
- allow selecting includeKeys areas from staticState areas
- test browser features for filter vs. opacity
- "resize" option
- improve startup speed by eliminating need for setTimeout callback
- address startup bug when images aren't loaded and there are lots of images
- fixed exception when "set" with no data for key
- bug when multiple images bound on same page \* another IE tweak: blur() on mouseover/click to remove browser-rendered border around area
- force "border=0" on image to ensure consistent display across bind/unbind in IE
- Fixed broken "onMouseover" option, added tests for onMouseover/onMouseout.
- many performance improvements, tests, refactoring some old inefficient code.
- fix css flickering when debinding/rebinding in HTML5 browsers
- add "scaleMap" option to automatically resize image maps when a bound image is resized dynamically. Enabled by default if an image is displayed at a size other than its native size.

## Version 1.1.3

- revised "highlight" method API (previously undocumented). Added tests & documented.
- added a generic prototype for parsing method data to improve consistency & stability
- added tests for tooltip external & event bound invocation
- added invoking tooltip from area, e.g. $('some-area').mapster('tooltip')
- added invoking tooltip from key, e.g. .mapster('tooltip',key);
- Bug fix for get_options, showToolTip (related)
- Bug fix - area id 0 on VML rendereding deselection causes all selections to disappear (introduced in beta 2)
- Changed "get" to return true "selected" state and not "isSelected()" which includes staticState items in selected.
- Bug fix - stroke sometimes rendered improperly when using render-specific options
- change onClick handler to BEFORE action, permit canceling of action by returning false
- refactor into mostly OO design - functional design was getting unwieldy.
- fix bugs related to cascading of "staticState" options
- add "snapshot" option
- check for existing wrapper, skip if it already exists
- remove map data when unbinding+preserveState -- it should act as if not there
- IE performance improvements (optimizing rendering code a little bit)

## Version 1.1.1 - 2011.06.03

  - added: "isMask" option (area-specific)
  - added: "includeKeys" option (area-specific)
- added: 'highlight' method to enable highlighting of areas from code

- Pass listTarget to onClick callback even when !isSelectable (previously passed null)
- Pass ref to toolTip element on callback
