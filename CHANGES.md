####Version 1.3.0 (planned)

Features:

* Return promises from asynchronous events rather than requiring callbacks like "onConfigured"
* Return a non-jQuery object exposing the imagemapster API to simplify coding against it

####version 1.2.7 (in development)

*tooltip-enhancements branch*

* [Issue 72](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/72): `scaleMap` not working propery when using bootstrap (css on `body` causing incorrect evaluation of native image size)
* Enhanced tooltip API to allow creating arbitrary tool tips bound to any area, or at an arbitrary position. 

*altimage-enhancements branch*

* Add `altImages` option that accepts an option defining aliases to alternate images. The name of each property is an alias that can be specified as a valid `altImage` option value elsewhere

Example use of this option:



    altImages: {
       roadmap: 'images/usamap-roads.png',
       elevation: 'images/uasmap-elevation.png'
    }

then:

    $('img').mapster('set',true,'AZ', {
		altImage: 'roadmap' 
	});


The aliases can also be used in the initial configuration options, both globally and for specific areas.


####version 1.2.6 - 2012.07.13

Bug Fixes:

* [Issue #69](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/69) `fill` setting not being honored sometimes in IE6-8
* [Issue #68](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/68) Accept `areas` array with dangling commas

####version 1.2.5 - 2012.06.19



Bug fixes:

* [Issue #59](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/59), [Issue #55](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/55) Opacity/fade effects not working right in IE8
* [Issue #58](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/58) Resize not changing CSS for the `div` contiainer around the image elements
* [Issue #53](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/53) Not working in Google Chrome with Adblock plugin
* [Issue #44](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/44) Incorrect opacity with altImage
* [Issue #36](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/36) Resize firing callback before resize is finished
* Rebind not cleaning up resources properly
* Offset 1 pixel strokes by 0.5 px to prevent the fuzzies
* Ignore UI events during resize - can cause problems if highlights are activated during an effect


Features: 

* [Issue #52](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/52) Add "clickNavigate" feature to allow basic imagemap functionality 
* Add "highlight" option to programatically set/unset the highlight effect (as if a user just moused over an area vs. clicked)
* Detect touchscreen devices and disable "mouseover"
* [Issue #11](https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster/issues/11) Detect excanvas automatically and force into IE mode if present

Notes

* refactor into modular architecture
* tighten up tooltip code a little
* Removed "attrmatches" jQuery selector exetnsion, recoded as a function, removed from tests
* Queue all methods (highlight, data, tooltip) so configuration delays don't cause problems 
* Unbind "load" event explicitly from images added. 
* Add dynamic images to DOM instead of loading through Javascript
* Ignore missing keys on some operations to increase stability with bad data
* Trim results of string splits so spaces don't cause problems
* Yet more tweaking of image loading detection
* Refactor "graphics" into an object and instantiate for each instance. "load" callbacks were changing event order, resulting in the single instance getting wires crossed. Isolated
each map instance completely, problem solved.
* Fix canvases re-ordered after first selection making effect sometimes inconsistent
* Fix resize bug when area groups are used

####version 1.2.4 - 2011.09.27

####version 1.2.2 - 2011.09.22

* masks not working in Firefox 6.0 only. behavior of context.globalCompositeOperation='source-out' and
  save/restore somehow changed in ff6. updated code to not depend (possibly) on idiosyncracies of chrome 
  and ie9. honestly not sure why it  worked before as it appears I may have been doing something wrong, 
  but the code is more explicit now and it works across all browsers.
